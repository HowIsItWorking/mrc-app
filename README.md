### This, as for now, only works inside a network.

> I'm pretty sure you will find a way to make it better, go on and try it!
> This was made recreating fireship's simple chat video (link bellow), I just tried to do a little more on top.
> It's not safe, any help with data security would be very appretiated.
> I's not pretty, any help with design would be very appretiated.

### It's not good. But I tried something new!
> I think that making a new thing or at least trying is something to be proud of.
> Specially with programing, reimagining something can lead you to a lot of places.
> You most likely won't learn from this, maybe you will dislike it even, but I tried!
> I hope you try new things too! I hope you find joy in experimenting and in going beyond.
> I know I haven't done anything spetacullar in particular, and that is okay! I'm learning
> And learn I did. Thank you for passing by, stranger. Happy coding!
